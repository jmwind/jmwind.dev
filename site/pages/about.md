Hi, nice to meet you. My name is Jean-Michel. I've worked in tech for 30 years, building software and then building teams and companies.

I'm a software developer and have built and led teams of 1 to 3,000. I was a founding member on the Eclipse platform and open source team, and then led and scaled the engineering orgs at Atlassian and Shopify from hundreds to thousands of developers.

Community and education are big passions and co-founded Canadian Tech @ Scale which brings together tech leaders from across Canada and founded DevDegree.ca which is an accrediated work-integrated computer science degree unlike any other.

Outside of writing, I'm also working as an LP and advisor with Generation IM and advisor/board with a few companies: BuildKite, AlayaCare, OpsLevel, Search.io, Omaze, BenchSci, Avant Art, Govalo.

I'm highly influenced by the book Drawing from the right side of the brain. While drawing was never my profession, learning to draw helped me see things that others around me often didn't see. The book was also an inspiration for the name of my website.

Here are some recent interviews and talks that can help you get to know me:
