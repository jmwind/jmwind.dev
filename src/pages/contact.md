A friend once asked for permission to share my email with someone who could use my help. I said "you're living in the 90s" by asking.

My DMs are always open. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmwind) ⎮ [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/jmlemieux-613) ⎮ [Email](mailto:jml@buildrightside.com)

It doesn't cost much to ignore DMs, so instead I optimize to hear from anyone. I've met amazing people in my DMs and some are still friends. You learn a ton. I love the internet!

I can't promise to get back to everyone. If I'm programming, writing, or sailing, it's quite possible that there's no time. But I'll read everything at some point and who knows.

### How can I help?

- **Talk**: Invite me to give a presentation and Q&A about my book or more generally around leading and scaling technical teams and companies. There's a lot of nuances and context needed to apply some of the suggestions in my book and it's often useful to dig into them with a team.
- **Consulting**: I don't have a lot of time for longer term engagements these days, but I'm happy to troubleshoot and discuss for few hours. For quick questions or feedback, I'd prefer email with a lot of context and a few questions. It means we won't have to coordinate schedules. But for a few hours and a deepdive into a few gnarly problems, reach out to schedule.
- **Board or advising**: I'm currently full in terms of board roles and longer term advising commitments. But that's ok, see the _consulting_ point above, we can do a lot with a few calls.
- **Angel or seed investing**: I'm a much better builder than investor. But my wife runs her own fund and feel free to reach out to her [hi@beetreecapital.ca](mailto:hi@beetreecapital.ca).
